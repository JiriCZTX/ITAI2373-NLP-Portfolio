        "**Challenge 2:** Context and shared understanding are crucial since we often depend on information beyond individual sentences, such as previous discussions, cultural insights, customs, and the speaker's intention.

Expressions like ‚Äúkick the bucket,‚Äù ‚Äúspill the tea,‚Äù or localized slang often do not translate literally. Literal processing leads to incorrect output that lacks meaning.
