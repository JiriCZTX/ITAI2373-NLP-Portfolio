**Institution:** Houston Community College  
**Professional Background:** Human Resources in Energy Industry

## Course Overview

Throughout this advanced NLP course, I developed expertise in text processing, machine learning for language understanding, and building intelligent systems that can analyze and understand human language. My work progressed from basic preprocessing techniques to sophisticated AI applications, with particular focus on practical applications relevant to HR and business environments.

## Laboratory Work

### Lab 02: Basic Text Preprocessing
I implemented fundamental text preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stop word removal, and text normalization. This foundation was crucial for all subsequent NLP tasks, where I learned to clean and prepare text data for analysis. I applied these skills to real-world scenarios like processing employee feedback and performance reviews.

### Lab 04: Text Representation 
I explored various text representation methods including TF-IDF, word embeddings, and vector space models. I implemented bag-of-words approaches and compared different vectorization techniques to understand how computers process human language. This knowledge became essential for analyzing communication patterns in professional settings.

### Lab 05: Part-of-Speech Tagging
I built POS taggers using both rule-based and statistical approaches. This work taught me about syntactic analysis and how to extract grammatical information from text, which became essential for more advanced NLP tasks and understanding the structure of written communications in business contexts.

### Lab 07: Sentiment and Emotion Analysis
I developed sentiment analysis systems capable of detecting emotions in text. I worked with various machine learning models to classify text sentiment and explored real-world applications in social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis. This has direct applications to HR for analyzing employee satisfaction surveys and communication patterns.

## Major Projects

## Reflection

This course transformed my understanding of how computers can process and understand human language. I progressed from basic text manipulation to building sophisticated AI systems that can engage in meaningful conversations and extract insights from large text corpora. The hands-on approach of building real applications reinforced theoretical concepts and prepared me for implementing NLP solutions in professional environments.

The NewsBot project particularly demonstrated how NLP can solve real-world problems, from automating content analysis to enabling intelligent human-computer interaction. Working with cutting-edge technologies like OpenAI's models showed me the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and the importance of staying current with new developments.

From an HR perspective, this course equipped me with powerful tools for enhancing employee experience, improving communication analysis, and making data-driven decisions about workforce management. The ability to automatically analyze large volumes of text data opens new possibilities for understanding employee sentiment, identifying communication patterns, and optimizing organizational processes.
